    "\n",
    "+  <font face=\"Times New Roman\"><font size = \"4\">Initially, we will randomly start a first search on the terrain map. That is point to the right cell with the probability of 1/2500. Which is a tiny value even waive to consider the situation of false negative. After this search, we will update the probability (based on the ***rule1*** or ***rule2***) for each cell.</font>\n",

    "#### <font face=\"Times New Roman\"><font size=\"4\">Stage 2: reduce the searching area.</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "+  <font face=\"Times New Roman\"><font size = \"4\">However, after first search, we will reduce the scale of search area into two two type of terrains for the worst case and only one type of terrain cell for a optimal case. </font>\n",
    "+  <font face=\"Times New Roman\"><font size = \"4\">In our algorithm, we use a dictionary to collect those reduced cells and their probabilities. For example, if the report we get from target is ***(Flat, Hill)***, we will collect flat cells and hill cells into one dictionary and then normalize them: </font>\n",
    "\n",

    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "+  <font face=\"Times New Roman\"><font size = \"4\">Before normalization, we will delete the cells that are not adjacent with another type of cell. In this case, flat cell (3, 0) is not adjacent with any cells in hill, so we delete it. Hill cell (4, 2) is also in the same case.</font>\n",

    "\n",
    "+  <font face=\"Times New Roman\"><font size = \"4\">However, when the report changed, for example we get a report ***(Hill, Forest)***, we can easily reduce the searching scale to the ***forest cells***. The intersection of the report sets is the previous step and the last is the current type of cell that target exist.</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "+  <font face=\"Times New Roman\"><font size = \"4\">In this case, we can use the knowledge base, to expand it, for example: Initially, we have:</font>\n",

    "First\\_Filtered\\_Flat &= \\{ (0,1): 0.1, (2,2): 0.1\\} \\\\\\\\\n",

    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "+  <font face=\"Times New Roman\"><font size = \"4\">Now we get the report: ***(Forest, Hill)***, since we already know all the Forest cells. Initially, their probabilities are zero according to the previous information, suppose the dictionary for forest cells is:</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",

    "\n",
    "+  <font face=\"Times New Roman\"><font size = \"4\">Then, using the filtered hill cells to filter forest cells and initialize the probability of each cell.</font>\n",

For example, $A \\in Type1$, $C \\in Type1$ and $B \\in Type2$, if we can confirm that target is moving from Type1 to Type2 and both A and C are adjacent to B, the number of branches from cell A to Type2 is ***numA***, the number of branches from cell C to Type2 is ***numC***, then the probability of B that inherited is: </font>\n",
